### Task-Fragmentation

## AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

-My Pick - Fragmentation of UI

### My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that
- I have created 3 components for BurnStatsContainer, BurnButtonBar, BurnBtn
- These are three components which are too large and affecting readability of code and these componets receiving props
from other functions / states so i believed these components can be seperated from main file by passing values as props and it will not affect UI 
or functionality.
- I was only able to fragment this much so far
